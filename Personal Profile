<p> Hello, my name is Roman Denisenko, originally I’m from Russia, but I live in US since 2009, 
and a U.S. citizen since 2015. I have few hobbies that I enjoy doing, for instance photography is my passion, for me longboarding 
is not a hobby, it more of a lifestyle. I was interested in photography since I was in high school,
I took couple intro courses there and I stated to realize that photography is not just about 
taking pictures, it is more than that; photography is a type of art which represents more than it 
shows in a picture. Especially conceptual photography is all about the representation of a picture,
Than about a picture itself.

<p> When I was in 7 grade I began to be interested in skateboarding, and after a while I forgot about it, and 4 years
ago I reintroduced my-self to a type of boarding which is called longboarding. There are different 
styles of how a person could ride a longboard, but my favorite is free ride, it is a combination of 
downhill and doing tricks with a board. The reason that I like longboarding it’s because it’s not just being on a 
board and ride around, it is a style and culture you diving into; and going downhill lets you forget about everything.
